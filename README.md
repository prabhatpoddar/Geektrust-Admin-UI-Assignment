###About Project
The Geektrust Admin Panel UI project is a web-based application that allows you to manage data through an API. The goal of this project is to create a user-friendly interface that enables administrators to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the data, implement pagination, and search functionality.

The interface is designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind, with the main menu consisting of basic CRUD operations such as Add, Edit, and Delete. The data is presented in a tabular format that allows administrators to sort and filter data easily.

The pagination feature allows administrators to navigate through a large amount of data with ease. The search functionality is also included, which allows administrators to search for specific data based on certain criteria.

Overall, the Geektrust Admin Panel UI project provides an easy-to-use, secure, and scalable solution for managing data through an API.
